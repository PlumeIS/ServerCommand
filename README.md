ServerCommand
===

Add Vanilla Server Command (op, deop, ban, etc) in Lan Server.  
Mod won't save op list. If Player leave the game and rejoin, thay will loss their op.   

---

If you switch `allowCheatsForAllPlayers` to ON, Mod still won't give all player op.  
If you were executed `deop`, You still have 4 `PermissionLevel` (Only you, Lan Server Owner.)
